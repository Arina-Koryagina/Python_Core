Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman. "Good Omens" (In the beginning)

It was a nice day.
All the days had been nice. There had been rather more than seven of them so far, and rain had not
been invented yet. But clouds massing east of Eden suggested that the first thunderstorm was on its way,
and it was going to be a big one.
The angel of the Eastern Gate put his wings over his head to shield himself from the first drops.
"I am sorry," he said politely. "What was it you were saying?"
"I said, that one went down like a lead balloon," said the serpent.
"Oh. Yes," said the angel, whose name was Aziraphale.
"I think it was a bit of an overreaction, to be honest," said the serpent. "I mean, first offense and
everything. I can not see what is so bad about knowing the difference between good and evil, anyway."
"It must be bad," reasoned Aziraphale, in the slightly concerned tones of one who can not see it either,
and is worrying about it, "otherwise you would not have been involved."
"They just said, Get up there and make some trouble," said the serpent, whose name was Crawly,
although he was thinking of changing it now. Crawly, he had decided, was not hint
"Yes, but you are a demon. I am not sure if it is actually possible for you to do good," said Aziraphale.
"It is down to your basic, you know, nature. Nothing personal, you understand."
"You have got to admit it is a bit of a pantomime, though," said Crawly. "I mean, pointing out the Tree
and saying 'Do not Touch' in big letters. Not very subtle, is it? I mean, why not put it on top of a high
mountain or a long way off? Makes you wonder what He is really planning."
"Best not to speculate, really," said Aziraphale. "You ca not second-guess ineffability, I always say.
There is Right, and there is Wrong. If you do Wrong when you are told to do Right, you deserve to be
punished. Er."
They sat in embarrassed silence, watching the raindrops bruise the first flowers.
Eventually Crawly said, "Did not you have a flaming sword?"
"Er," said the angel. A guilty expression passed across his face, and then came back and camped
there.
"You did, did not you?" said Crawly. "It flamed like anything."
"Er, well-"
"It looked very impressive, I thought."
"Yes, but, well-"
"Lost it, have you?"
"Oh no! No, not exactly lost, more-"
"Well?"
Aziraphale looked wretched. "If you must know," he said, a trifle testily, "I gave it away."
Crawly stared up at him.
"Well, I had to," said the angel, rubbing his hands distractedly. "They looked so cold, poor things,
and she is expecting already, and what with the vicious animals out there and the storm coming up I
thought, well, where is the harm, so I just said, look, if you come back there is going to be an almighty
row, but you might be needing this sword, so here it is, do not bother to thank me, just do everyone a big
favor and do not let the sun go down on you here."
He gave Crawly a worried grin.
"That was the best course, was not it?"
"I am not sure it is actually possible for you to do evil," said Crawly sarcastically. Aziraphale did not
notice the tone.
"Oh, I do hope so," he said. "I really do hope so. It is been worrying me all afternoon."
They watched the rain for a while.
"Funny thing is," said Crawly, "I keep wondering whether the apple thing was not the right thing to
do, as well. A demon can get into real trouble, doing the right thing." He nudged the angel. "Funny if we
both got it wrong, eh? Funny if I did the good thing and you did the bad one, eh?"
"Not really," said Aziraphale.
Crawly looked at the rain.
"No," he said, sobering up. "I suppose not."
Slate-black curtains tumbled over Eden. Thunder growled among the hills. The animals, freshly
named, cowered from the storm.
Far away, in the dripping woods, something bright and fiery flickered among the trees.
It was going to be a dark and stormy night.
